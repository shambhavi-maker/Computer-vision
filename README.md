# Computer Vision Projects

This repository is a collection of diverse projects exploring various aspects of **computer vision**. From fundamental image processing to advanced deep learning applications, these projects aim to provide practical implementations and a hands-on understanding of how computers "see" and interpret the world.

## What You'll Find

* **Image Classification:** Projects that demonstrate how to train models to categorize images (e.g., identifying different types of animals, objects, or scenes).
* **Object Detection:** Implementations of techniques to locate and classify multiple objects within an image or video, often by drawing bounding boxes around them.
* **Image Segmentation:** Projects focusing on partitioning an image into multiple segments or objects, often at a pixel level for detailed analysis.
* **Facial Recognition & Analysis:** Explorations into identifying individuals from images or videos and analyzing facial attributes like emotions or age.
* **Real-time Applications:** Examples of computer vision models deployed for live processing of video streams, showcasing immediate practical uses.
* **Generative Models:** Projects that involve creating new images or modifying existing ones based on learned patterns and data.

## Technologies & Libraries

The projects primarily leverage **Python** and widely used computer vision libraries, including:

* **OpenCV:** For traditional image processing, feature extraction, and foundational computer vision tasks.
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For building and training deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
* **PyTorch:** Another popular deep learning framework used in some projects for its flexibility and dynamic computation graph.
* **Scikit-learn / NumPy / Matplotlib:** For data manipulation, numerical operations, and powerful data visualization.

## Getting Started

Each project typically resides in its own dedicated folder, containing:

* A **`README.md`** with a detailed description of the project, its goals, methodology, results, and clear instructions for replication.
* **Jupyter Notebooks** or **Python scripts** that contain the core code for the project.
* A **`requirements.txt`** file listing all necessary libraries and their specific versions.
* A **`data/`** directory (if applicable) with sample datasets or instructions on where to obtain them.

To run a project, simply navigate to its directory, install the required dependencies (it's highly recommended to use a virtual environment), and follow the instructions provided in its respective `README.md`.
