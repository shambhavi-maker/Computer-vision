## What You'll Find

* **Image Classification:** Projects that demonstrate how to train models to categorize images (e.g., identifying different types of animals, objects, or scenes).
* **Object Detection:** Implementations of techniques to locate and classify multiple objects within an image or video, often by drawing bounding boxes around them.
* **Image Segmentation:** Projects focusing on partitioning an image into multiple segments or objects, often at a pixel level for detailed analysis.
* **Facial Recognition & Analysis:** Explorations into identifying individuals from images or videos and analyzing facial attributes like emotions or age.
* **Real-time Applications:** Examples of computer vision models deployed for live processing of video streams, showcasing immediate practical uses.
* **Generative Models:** Projects that involve creating new images or modifying existing ones based on learned patterns and data.

## Technologies & Libraries

The projects primarily leverage **Python** and widely used computer vision libraries, including:

* **OpenCV:** For traditional image processing, feature extraction, and foundational computer vision tasks.
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For building and training deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
* **PyTorch:** Another popular deep learning framework used in some projects for its flexibility and dynamic computation graph.
* **Scikit-learn / NumPy / Matplotlib:** For data manipulation, numerical operations, and powerful data visualization.
